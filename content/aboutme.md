title: 'About me'
---
Hi. I'm Full stack developer located in Poland. Currently I'm studying at the Politechnika Wrocławska (PWR) at the faculty "Informatyka i zarządanie" (IT and management). Major of my studies is "Informatyka stosowana" (Applied Computer Science) and I'm studying since 2019.

I have choosen this major of studies to realize one of my passions which is developing working software. Apart this I'm interested in all sorts of electronics. But especially racing drones and 3d printers. I keep doing all sorts of physical activities to keep my body rest after long screen sessions, but my favorite ones are long bicycle rides.

Log time ago I was also designing some 3d models as a hobby ([link](https://www.thingiverse.com/ernest13/designs)), but lack of mentoring and time after starting studies make me stop developing these skills.

I was also a member of student science club [“Solvro” ](https://solvro.pwr.edu.pl/). Here I worked as Frontend developer in project “lokalniej”. We were designing administrator panel for this app using ant design. 

Feel free to contact me I have some private repos on GitHub To show. I'm looking for to gain some practises in comertial work.
