Hi. I'm Full stack developer located in Poland. Currently I'm studing at the Politechnika Wrocławska (PWR) at the facluty "Informatyka i zarządanie" (IT and management). Major of my studies is "Informatyka stosowana" (Applied Computer Science) and I'm studying since 2019.

I have choosen this major of studies to realize one of my passions wich is developing working sowtware. Apart this I'm intrested in all sorts of elecronics. But espacialy racing drones and 3d printers. I keep doing all sorts of physical activities to keep my body rest after long screen sessions, but my favourite ones are long bicycle rides.

Currently I'm looking for to gain some practises in commercial work.
